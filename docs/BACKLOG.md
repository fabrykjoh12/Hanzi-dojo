# 🛠️ Engineering backlog

Granular fixes, tech-debt, and ops tasks. **Internal — not community-facing.**
The public plan lives in [`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md), which auto-posts to the
`#roadmap` Discord channel; keep raw bug detail and dashboard-only steps here so
that stays clean. Move items to **Done** as they land (or promote user-facing
ones to the roadmap).

## Auth / email / hosting
- [ ] **Custom SMTP** — send auth mail from `no-reply@hanzi-dojo.com` (add SPF/DKIM/DMARC DNS) so sign-in emails aren't the default `mail.app.supabase.io` sender. Supabase → Authentication → Emails → SMTP Settings. *(dashboard)*
- [ ] **Auth URL config** — set Site URL = `https://hanzi-dojo.com` and add redirect allowlist `https://hanzi-dojo.com/**` + `http://localhost:5173/**`. Fixes the login redirect that jumps to the raw github.io host. *(dashboard)*
- [ ] **Turn off the retired GitHub Pages site** — repo Settings → Pages → Source → None. The deploy workflow is already removed; this disables the last-built site.

Already shipped (code side): `signUp` now sends `emailRedirectTo`; hardcoded github.io links replaced with `BRAND_URL`; app consolidated on Vercel (base `/`).

## Data safety
- [ ] **Transactional grading** — collapse the separate writes (card update, review log, daily activity, XP) into a single Supabase RPC/transaction so a mid-write failure can't leave partial state. See the data-safety note in `README.md` and `src/syncQueue.js`.
- [ ] **Real-device verification pass** — offline grade replay + XP-delta reconcile, iOS/Safari flashcard + reader audio, and Web Push reminders end-to-end. All built and unit-tested but never exercised on a live device.

## Scheduling
- [ ] **Timezone-correct reminders** — `send-review-reminders.mjs` fires on a plain UTC hour, so it drifts ~1h across DST. Schedule per user timezone.

## Learning quality
- [ ] **FSRS parameter tuning** — optimize scheduler parameters beyond library defaults once `review_logs` + analytics have real data.

## Content
- [ ] **Chinese → HSK 3**: seed the HSK 3 vocab band, then run `generate-meanings` → `generate-examples` → `generate-serial-stories` → `generate-audio`/`generate-story-audio`. Add HSK 3 tiers to `storyTiers.js` and level labels in `utils.js`.
- [ ] **Japanese JLPT N4+ / Russian A2+**: same pipeline per new level; extend the level/tier config so onboarding offers them (Onboarding gates on seeded levels already).
- [ ] More graded stories at existing levels (volume, not just new levels) — improves the "read next" ladder density.
- [ ] **Spanish track**: add a `spanish` entry to `languageTheme.js` (accent, font, system=CEFR), level list + tiers in `storyTiers.js`, seed CEFR vocab, generate content. Onboarding/data layers are already data-driven, so most of the app picks it up for free.

## Media
- [ ] **Pictures on flashcards**: generate/source one image per vocab item (image-gen pipeline → Supabase Storage `images/` bucket, mirror of the audio flow), add `image_path` to `vocabulary`, render lazily on the card back. Keep it optional so a missing image degrades cleanly.
- [ ] **Better TTS**: current narration is Google TTS (`generate-audio.mjs`, `generate-story-audio.mjs`). Evaluate more natural voices (e.g. Azure Neural, ElevenLabs, OpenAI TTS) per language, pick voices, regenerate vocab + story audio; watch blob size / offline-cache cost. A/B a sample before mass regen.

## Video (graded YouTube — the flagship idea)
Turn the current recommended-videos list (`YouTube.jsx`, `youtube_recommendations`) into graded comprehensible input — the video analog of the story reader:
- [ ] Fetch a video's **caption/transcript** by video id (YouTube timedtext / caption tracks); handle the no-captions case gracefully.
- [ ] Reuse `storyReading.js` to compute **% known** over the transcript and make words **tappable** (define / add to deck), exactly like the reader.
- [ ] **Sync the transcript to playback** (YouTube IFrame API `getCurrentTime`/state events) — highlight the current line, tap a line to seek.
- [ ] **Pre-teach flow**: surface the top-N unknown words as quick flashcards before watching.
- [ ] **Level-matched library**: tag recommendations with level + a computed "% you'll understand" badge so browsing mirrors the graded-story ladder.

## Frontend cleanup
- [ ] Continue extracting the large `Study` screen into focused hooks/components.
- [ ] Supabase generated types (gradual TypeScript adoption).
- [ ] Centralize design tokens (colors/spacing/shadows) beyond the current shared primitives.

## Done
- [x] Onboarding language cards render equal width — the longer "Русский" label no longer stretches the Russian card past the two CJK cards (`src/Onboarding.jsx`).
- [x] Story reader no longer dead-ends: "learn N more to unlock the next tier" hook (`src/StoryReaderImmersive.jsx`, `nextLockedTier`).
